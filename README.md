## Description
Welcome to the Social Underground, a place where you can meet with friends and play some games in a virtual casino. This is an application built so that users do not need multiple windows open to play a game and chat. The user will be able to be able to hangout with their friends while playing a fun game of blackjack or rock paper scissors at one of our "tables".
